How to Run Locally
To view this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the files:
If this project is hosted on GitHub, you can clone it using Git:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

Otherwise, ensure you have index.html, style.css, and script.js (and the assests folder with images) in the same directory.

Open index.html:
Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file.

The website should load in your browser, and you can interact with all its features.

Important Note on Contact Form
The contact form in this project currently uses JavaScript to save submitted messages to the browser's Local Storage. This means:

Messages are saved only on the visitor's browser. You, as the portfolio owner, will not receive these messages directly.

This implementation is primarily for demonstration purposes of client-side data handling.

To make the contact form fully functional and receive messages, you would need to integrate a backend service or a third-party form provider. Examples include:

Backend: Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, PHP, etc., to handle form submissions and send emails.

Third-Party Services: Formspree, Netlify Forms, Getform, etc., which provide endpoints to receive form data and forward it to your email.

Customization
Content: Edit index.html to update text, links, and project details.

Styling: Modify style.css to change colors, fonts, layout, and other visual aspects.

JavaScript: Adjust script.js for any changes in interactive behavior or to integrate a live contact form solution.
